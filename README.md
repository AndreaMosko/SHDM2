## Introduction

During this course, students will learn how to build a predictive model using Dataiku DSS, a collaborative Data Science platform.  

While learning how to use the platform, students will be exposed to typical company use cases, falling into the Enterprise AI field.  

They will learn and re-learn Data Science core concepts, from the identification of a need up to the interpretation of Machine Learning model.  

They will also work with various Data Science technologies (including Python & SQL) to better analyse their data, and interact with the platform in a different way.  

Students will also go through every steps of a Data Science workflow (import, cleaning, analysing, visualising, feature engineering & predicting)  

## Structure of the repository

In this repository, you will find a folder for each class.  
The folder will contain the following:
- a `README.md` file with indications regarding:
  - **Class** presentation 
  - **Resources & external links** with resources used during the class
- most of the steps done during the hands on session, a link to the slides, pictures, records and code snippets (for **class02**, **class03**, **class04**)
- a `.zip` file with the correction of the hands-on in class (for **class02**, **class03**, **class04**) 

## Evaluation

The evaluation process has been adapted to be 100% online as well. The evaluation will consist in:
- 50% accounting for the results of your final exam
- 50% accounting for the content of your hands on sessions
